          <section class="content"><p>The Wipro Laptop had seen its good days, but its keypad went wrong (worked fine at night, and in the morning it was screwed up) and started displaying two characters upon one key press, its lan port and memory card slot wouldn’t ever work, its <span class="caps">CD</span>/DVD drive would get screwed up every 2 months and most recently its screen cracked ( dunno how it happened) and a vertical white line hid two characters behind it in text mode and equivalent area in graphics mode). The width of this white line was going on increasing and presently it covers area equivalent to 2 characters in text mode. These developments ( -ve sense) pushed me to get a new laptop for myself and this time I decided not to make the mistakes I had made the last time. I went for a Dell Studio 1450&nbsp;laptop.</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/links-text-based-web-browser/">links - text based web browser</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>It was around midnight, that my room-mate (who is a budding linux geek) saw me downloading kernel files using wget from a terminal without the help of any kind of grahpical web browser. Then we wondered, how cool it would be if we could use a text based web-browser for our general work like checking mail, facebook status, attendance over college’s intranet etc. I reckoned, it would be quite fast too because no imager or flash ads would be&nbsp;downloaded.</p>
<p>A few hours later I had accomplished installing xfce4 desktop manager on Arch Linux and was fiddling around with its features (which were nothing except a text editor, a terminal emulator and few configuration utilities). Just then a shortcut for a web-browser caught my eye and I couldn’t recall having installed pacakges of firefox or anything. Out of curiosity I clicked it open and bang a terminal window opened up !!! there it was !! I had discovered a text based web-browser&nbsp;!!!</p>
<p>Little bit of fooling around got me familiar with its <span class="caps">UI</span> which is nothing except a few menus that emerge when escape key is pressed. I opened google.com (dunno why but google.com is what comes to mind even when what I want  to do is just check internet connectivity). There was no limit of his excitement when I introduced Abhinandan to my marvellous discovery. Together we tried exploring a lot of sites on it. It was a new kind of experience looking at the usual web content in text mode. We searched wikipedia for the creator of “links” and checked our gmail accounts. However the intranet utility of our university wouldn’t let us log in ( a few months ago we could’t log in even from mozilla - only IE was supported :P so no worries).  Regular facebook didn’t show up properly, however m.facebook.com which is its mobile version, was wonderful, I updated my status and checked&nbsp;notifications.</p>
<p>Then my room-mate suggested how about downloading something .. so we opened an ftp site and pressed enter (which was equivalent to clicking there) on a link. A pop up menu appeared asking what I would like to do with the file ( display or a save). Actually display option opened any file in text mode and displayed its contents - which wasn’t something I wanted. Upon choosing save, another popup window appeared which displayed the progress of download. This one even contained an option for continuing the download in background which seemed to be quite useful for this kind of a&nbsp;browser.</p>
<p>And now here I am writing a blog post at about 6 <span class="caps">AM</span> using the same geeky&nbsp;browser.</p>
<p>Its not a very impressive but is quite wonderful (atleast for a comp-geek who had never seen something similar). Links sports a download manager, bookmark manager, short history, and a very helpful user’s manual:). It can come quite handy when we need to access internet while fixing up something on our linux box. For example I was using my other laptop for accessing the arch linux install guide for installing the distro and now I won’t need to. I can visit forums, check facebook status, mail, search for stuff even when I am fiddling around with the <span class="caps">OS</span> or am trying to get it back on after screwing it up&nbsp;;)</p>

            <h2><a href="/articles/finally-up-with-linux/">Finally Up with Linux!</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I have been interesed a lot in linux since past 3 yrs .. actually since the day I came to know about it. I tried a wide range of distros (Linux desktop environments) but found all of them <em>insufficient</em> (or you may say that I was <strong>inefficient</strong>) in some manner or the other. For example, the most famous distro among starters, <em>Ubuntu</em> did not work for me, I was unable to install some third party software on it. Similarly I could not connect to the internet (<span class="caps">BSNL</span> Broadband - when I was at home) from <em>OpenSolaris</em>. All went well with <em>Sabayon</em> 4 and <em>Fedora</em> 10 but they were extremely slow on my machine and hanged every now and&nbsp;then.</p>
<p>Finally I laid my hands on <strong>Mandirva Spring 2009</strong> when an internet friend of mine (he is just out of high school and writes for a famous Indian Opensourse Magazine) suggested it me to. Well, to be honest I liked it, even though there were certain issues (eg. could not configure my internet, once it went into standby could not be retrieved etc). Apart from that there were a host of useful softwares available in the installer <span class="caps">DVD</span> itself. And it was also easy enough to install new softwares on it (just needed to download and install .rpm packages). I installed Java SE SDK, NetBeans IDE and a few more softwares. I tried a lot to get it connected to my DSL but all in vain. Later I had to replace my windows hard drive for some sensitive hard&nbsp;drive.</p>
<p>I came back to my hostel (after vacations) and wondered whether I would be successful in setting up Wi-Fi connectivity. Initially it said it lacked a package called <strong>rt73 firmware</strong> and I thought of moving over to some other distro but decided to stick around some more. Now the most astonishing thing happened. I used a friend’s laptop to download the file, it turned out to be of just 3.7 <span class="caps">KB</span>. Well I being accustommed to windows, thought how could such an important file be so small and that there must have been some downloading error. So attempted downloaing again. But everytime the same file of the same size appeared. Well then with a little or rather no hope I ventured to install the package. Well, here i am presently, using the college’s Wi-Fi to post this bit. I guess there would be only LINUX enthusiasts can understand what I am feeling&nbsp;presently.</p>
